# Release Notes - v1.3.0

## Overview

Version 1.3.0 focuses on **simplification and reliability improvements** by rolling back to the proven v1.0.0 upload approach and removing unnecessary complexity.

## Key Changes

### üîÑ **Simplified Upload Process**
- **Rolled back to v1.0.0-style uploads**: Removed timeouts and retry logic that were causing issues
- **Removed progress bars**: Eliminated progress tracking that was interfering with upload reliability
- **Streamlined code**: Simplified upload modules for better stability

### üè∑Ô∏è **Removed Timestamp from Project Names**
- **Exact CSV titles**: Task titles now use the exact values from your CSV file
- **No automatic suffixes**: No more timestamp additions to project names
- **User control**: You have full control over task titles in your CSV

### üßπ **Streamlined Batch Processing**
- **Single batch module**: Consolidated batch operations into one `batch-full` module
- **Removed redundant functions**: Eliminated separate upload and task creation batch modules
- **Cleaner CLI**: Simplified command-line interface with fewer options

### üîß **Fixed Import Issues**
- **Module compatibility**: Fixed import errors between main client and batch module
- **Updated dependencies**: Corrected function imports to match available modules
- **Better error handling**: Improved error messages for missing functions

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This version removes some previously available functions:

- `run_batch_upload_module` - No longer available
- `run_batch_task_module` - No longer available
- `batch-upload` CLI option - Removed
- `batch-task` CLI option - Removed

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

1. **Update your scripts**: If you were using `batch-upload` or `batch-task`, switch to `batch-full`
2. **Check your CSV files**: Ensure unique titles in your CSV since timestamps are no longer added automatically
3. **Update imports**: If importing functions directly, remove references to deleted functions
